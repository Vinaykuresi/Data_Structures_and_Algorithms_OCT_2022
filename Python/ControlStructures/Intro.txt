Control Structures : 

    1) Sequential Structure 

        num1 = 30
        num2 = 40
        
        sum = num1 + num2 

        print(sum)
   
    2) Selection Structure : 

        person = "good"

        if(person == "good") :
            print("Make him friend)
        else :
            print("Keep him away")

            ex : if, if else, if elif else 

    3) Iteration Structure : 

        keep loop(Iteration):
            execute statements
        until conditon fails 

            ex:  for, while
